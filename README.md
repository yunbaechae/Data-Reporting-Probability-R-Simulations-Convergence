# Data Reporting in Probability: R Simulations for Convergence and Inequalities

STAT2372 Probability Assignment (2022)

This assignment focused on data-driven verification of probability theorems using R simulations. Emphasis was placed on reproducible reporting, empirical validation, clear visualization of simulation results, and structured documentation of theoretical concepts.

## Key Tasks
- Explored Markov inequalities and convergence theorems  
- Generated empirical distributions and convergence demonstrations via R  
- Produced clear outputs, plots, and summaries for statistical verification  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming (random number generation, simulations, plotting)  
- Reproducible data reporting and workflow documentation  
- Empirical summarization and visualization of probability results  
- Data-driven validation of theoretical concepts  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF (2372.pdf) is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all code chunks, outputs, and formatted results.)
